                                        You're not trying to stop feeling. You're learning to feel fully while choosing wisely. You're not trying to be perfect. You're practicing being aware. That awareness—that beautiful, hard-won space between stimulus and response—is where your freedom lives. Keep practicing. You're becoming someone who knows herself, trusts herself, and responds from that grounded place. This changes everything.
